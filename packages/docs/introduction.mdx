title: "What is Dittofeed?"
---

The first developer-centric, open-source, omni-channel customer engagement platform. It shares the value proposition of other omni-channel customer engagement platforms - Braze, Customer.io, One Signal, Segment Engage and others.

Customer engagement platforms allow marketing and growth teams to automate messaging on channels like email, SMS, and in-app push notifications.

## What makes Dittofeed different?

Dittofeed built from the bottom up with growth, and marketing engineers in mind.

**Open Source** 

Free and Open-Source forever.

**Git based workflow (coming soon)**

Check your email templates into git, don't write them in a browser editor.

**Monitoring and Alerting (coming soon)**

Understate the state of your users' journeys. Seemlessly integrate with OpenTelemtry for monitoring and alerting of your customer journeys.

**Test SDK (coming soon)**

A first-in-class Time-traveling test sdk for customer journeys. Catch regressions before they get deployed.

```javascript
describe("When the bookmark button is clicked", () => {
  let df: DittofeedTestEnv;

  beforeEach(async () => {
    df = await Dittofeed.setupTestEnv();
    ...
  })

  it("Emails the clicking user", async () => {
    render(<BookmarkButton/>)
    fireEvent.click(screen.getByText(/bookmark/i))

    // Using simulated time.
    await df.sleep("1 week");
    const messages = await df.fetchMessages();

    expect(messages).toEqual([
      expect.objectContaining({
        to: "test@email.com",
        type: "Email",
        body: expect.stringContaining("https://app.com/user-1/bookmarks")
      });
    ]);
  });
});
