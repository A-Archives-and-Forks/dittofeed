Journeys are the basic building block for messaging automation in Dittofeed. You use them to configure who gets messaged when and with what.

At a minimum journeys contain an [entry node](/resources/journey-nodes/entry), and an [exit node](/resources/journey-nodes/entry).

By itself, this journey does nothing. That's where a message node comes in.

There are other journey nodes which are available, and we're adding more all of the time!
