title: Self-Hosting Dittofeed
---

Dittofeed can be self-hosted on-prem, in addition to our [cloud service](/deployment/cloud).

## Reasons to Self-Host

* Keep all of your user data, including sensitive PII isolated within your own network.
* Pay for the support that your team needs, for what is otherwise an entirely free product.
