title: Using Segment.io as a Source
---

[Segment](https://segment.com/) is one of the most popular available "customer data platform"s - or "CDP" for short. Segment serves as a centralized repository user data, sourced from, and available to a variety of marketing, and analytics platforms - including Dittofeed.

Feed user data from Segment into Dittofeed to start sending users messages.

## Using a Self-Hosted Webhook Destination

You can send a self-hosted Dittofeed installation user data with a Segment webhook Destination.

<Info>Segment's [webhook destination documentation](https://segment.com/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/webhooks/).</Info>
<Tip>Check out Dittofeed's [guide on self-hosting](/deployment/self-hosted).</Tip>

Dittofeed receives segment data from its `POST /webhooks/segment` endpoint. To receive data from Segment, this path needs to be exposed to the internet by public dns.
