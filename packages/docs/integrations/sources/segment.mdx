[Segment](https://segment.com/) is one of the most popular available "customer data platform"s - or "CDP" for short. Segment serves as a centralized repository user data, sourced from, and available to a variety of marketing, and analytics platforms - including Dittofeed.

Feed user data from Segment into Dittofeed to start sending users messages.

You can send a self-hosted Dittofeed installation user data with a Segment webhook Destination.
